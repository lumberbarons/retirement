name: draft-spec
description: Draft a lightweight feature spec — description, prior decisions, prioritised user stories, a task list, and a done-when checklist — into specs/NNN-slug/spec.md in a fixed format enforced by a checker script. Use whenever a feature should be specified before it is built: "spec this out", "write a spec for X", "scope this feature", "plan this feature", "turn this into a task list", or a feature description handed over for planning. Produces a spec at status Draft; approving one is the separate approve-spec skill. Not for a single bug fix or a one-file change.

# draft-spec

Turn a feature request into one reviewable file: what it is, the decisions it
must respect, prioritised user stories, the tasks, and how anyone can tell it is
done. A script owns the format so every spec comes out identical; you supply the
judgment.

The process this serves is **ADR → spec → approve → implement**. This skill is
the drafting step. It reads decisions already recorded, and leaves something a
person or an agent can implement from. It writes no code, cuts no branches,
files no issues, and does not approve its own output — a spec leaves here at
`Draft`, and `approve-spec` is what moves it.

## The script

`scripts/lightspec.py` sits beside this file. Resolve it once against this
skill's own directory and reuse it through the steps below:

```bash
LIGHTSPEC="<this skill's directory>/scripts/lightspec.py"
```

A hardcoded `.claude/skills/...` path works only while the skill lives in a
repo checkout, and breaks the moment it is installed under `~/.claude/skills/`
or shipped in a plugin. It needs no virtualenv — the script is stdlib only.

## 1. Understand the request

Read what you were given. Ask only where a wrong guess would change the shape of
the work — scope boundaries, who the feature is for, what counts as done. At
most three questions, in a single `AskUserQuestion` call, each with a
recommended option first.

Do not ask what the codebase can tell you, and do not ask at all when the
request is already concrete. A spec built on one clarifying question and four
stated assumptions beats one built on five questions.

## 2. Collect the prior decisions

Find the recorded architecture decisions before writing anything:

```bash
ls docs/adr docs/decisions docs/adrs 2>/dev/null
find . -ipath "*adr*" -name "*.md" -not -path "./node_modules/*" | head
```

Read the ones that plausibly bear on this feature and check each one's status.
Cite the **accepted** ones; ignore superseded ones. For each citation write the
link and one line on the constraint it places on *this* feature — not a summary
of the ADR, which the reader can follow the link for.

`check` resolves every citation link against the repository, so a plausible-
looking path to an ADR that does not exist is caught rather than believed. Cite
what you actually found.

Three cases worth handling deliberately:

- **Nothing applies.** Write `- None`. Do not pad the section.
- **The feature would contradict an accepted decision.** Say so in the bullet,
  plainly, and raise it in your report. Diverging quietly is the failure mode
  this section exists to prevent; the user may want a new ADR before the spec is
  worth finishing.
- **The feature forces a decision nobody has recorded.** Put it in Assumptions
  and note it deserves an ADR of its own.

## 3. Ground it in the code

Skim enough of the repo to name real files in the task list. You are locating
the seams the work will touch, not auditing them — a few searches, not a survey.

## 4. Generate the skeleton

```bash
uv run --no-project "$LIGHTSPEC" new "Price Drop Watchlist" --stories 2
```

Decide the story count from step 1. The script auto-numbers from the highest
existing `specs/NNN-`, derives the slug from the title, refuses to overwrite,
and prints the path it wrote. Keep that path — step 6 checks it.

## 5. Fill it in

Replace every `<FILL: ...>` marker. The marker text is the instruction for that
slot — delete it as you go. `reference/example-spec.md` is a filled spec written
to be imitated.

| Section | What belongs there |
|---|---|
| Description | What this is, who it serves, why it is worth doing now. No technology choices. |
| Prior Decisions | Step 2's citations, each with the constraint it imposes here. |
| Out of Scope | What a reader would otherwise assume is included. This is where scope creep dies. |
| Assumptions | Every place you guessed, stated so a reader can disagree with a specific line. |
| User Stories | `As a <role>, I want <capability> so that <outcome>`, then 1-2 lines: the flow, the constraint that shapes it, the edge case that matters. |
| Tasks | One line each, grouped under the story it serves, `Cross-cutting` for the rest, each naming real paths. |
| Done When | Observable claims someone else could check without reading the diff. |

The header above the sections is stamped for you. `**Status**` is the one field
with a life after this skill: `new` writes `Draft`, and draft-spec never moves
it off `Draft`. You are writing a proposal, not ratifying one — advancing it is the
`approve-spec` skill, invoked deliberately by a person, and the checker holds
the vocabulary closed so it cannot decay into free text.

| Status | Means |
|---|---|
| `Draft` | Written, not yet agreed. Everything `new` produces starts here. |
| `Accepted` | Agreed. Build from it. Set by `approve-spec`, never here. |
| `Implemented` | Built and merged. Kept as the record of what was intended. |
| `Superseded` | Replaced — and it must link what replaced it, for the same reason a cited decision carries a link. |

Nothing else passes the check, and only `Superseded` may carry text after the
word: `**Status**: Superseded by [011 Watchlist v2](../011-watchlist-v2/spec.md)`.

Priorities carry meaning: **P1** is what makes the feature worth shipping at
all, **P2/P3** what makes it good. Order stories by priority, and write them at
the altitude of the person using the software — "As a shopper, I want…", never
"As a developer, I want a repository interface".

Done-when items are the acceptance test. "Clicking watch twice leaves exactly
one row and reports success both times" — not "the watchlist works". Write them
so a stranger could run them.

## 6. Check

Check the exact path step 4 printed:

```bash
uv run --no-project "$LIGHTSPEC" check specs/009-price-drop-watchlist/spec.md
```

Fix what it reports and run it again until it prints `ok`. Never report the spec
finished while the check fails.

Do not reach for `--latest`. It resolves to the highest-numbered directory under
`specs/`, which in a repo that used another spec tool is a spec in a format
lightspec knows nothing about. Pointed at one of those, the checker reports
failures for a file this feature never touched — and the instruction above,
"fix what it reports", would then have you rewriting somebody else's spec.

The checker sees shape only. It cannot tell you a done-when item is unfalsifiable
or that a story is really three stories. That judgment stays yours — re-read the
Done When section once with the checker green and ask whether each line could
actually be verified by someone who did not write the code.

## 7. Report

Give the path, the story and task counts, and anything you assumed that the user
should overturn. Say the spec is at `Draft` and that `/approve-spec` is the next
step if they want it reviewed and accepted. Then stop. Do not begin implementing,
do not approve it yourself, and do not file the tasks anywhere unless asked.

## Portability

Nothing in the format is tied to a tracker. The vocabulary lines up with common
issue-body conventions: one task is about one issue, `Done When` items drop
straight into a done-when checklist, and P0–P4 matches the usual priority
labels. If this repo uses an issue tracker, filing is the user's next step and
their call, not something this skill does.

## Anti-patterns

- Technology in the Description — it belongs in the tasks, or in an ADR
- Done-when items that restate tasks; a task is work, a done-when is evidence
- Empty Out of Scope or Assumptions when the request was genuinely ambiguous
- Padding Prior Decisions with ADRs that do not actually constrain this feature
- More than about eight stories or twenty-five tasks — that is two features
- Cutting a branch, filing issues, or writing code from this skill

## Maintaining the script

```bash
python3 -m unittest discover "$(dirname "$LIGHTSPEC")"
```

The skeleton and the checker define the same format in two places. The tests
pin them together: a fresh skeleton must fail the check for its `<FILL: ...>`
markers and nothing else, and `reference/example-spec.md` must pass. Change the
format in `scripts/lightspec.py` and those two tests tell you what else moved.
